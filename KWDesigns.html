  <p>Hi there! my name is Kristoffer Williams, I am a passionate and dedicated graphic designer with a focus on delivering creative solutions that make an impact. My journey as a designer has been shaped by a love for storytelling and visual communication, which drives me to craft designs that resonate with audiences and fulfill client objectives.</p>

    <p>As a UX Designer for a school project with Fresh Fare Farms as the focus, I created a user-centered promotional flyer to simulate a real-world campaign promoting sustainable meal kits. The goal was to design an engaging and accessible layout that clearly communicated the brand’s mission while encouraging user participation. I applied core UX principles such as visual hierarchy, intuitive flow, and emotional appeal through the use of compelling imagery, readable typography, and strategically placed calls to action. The project emphasized community impact by highlighting local sourcing, environmental benefits, and a Hunger Action Month initiative. This school project allowed me to practice designing with purpose and empathy, ultimately strengthening my skills in crafting user-friendly marketing materials.</p><div class="text-center">

    <h3>Donnt T </h3>
    <p>As the designer and typographic illustrator for this piece, I created a text-based portrait using carefully arranged lyrics to form the contours and details of the subject's face and upper body. My role involved blending visual storytelling with expressive typography to turn words into imagery. The impact of this work lies in its ability to merge language and likeness into a cohesive artistic statement—demonstrating how text can function as both communication and composition. It highlights my skills in creative layout, type manipulation, and conceptual design.</p><div class="text-center">

I designed the visual hierarchy to prioritize user needs—highlighting departure info, seat and platform details, and ticket features like WiFi. The use of icons, bold typography, and minimal color accents supports quick scanning and mobile usability. This design improves the user experience by reducing confusion and ensuring key information is easy to find at a glance, contributing to smoother travel and better customer satisfaction.</p><div class="text-center">
